#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining software in a structured and efficient way. It ensures software is reliable, functional, and meets user needs. Its importance in the tech industry lies in creating high-quality products, solving complex problems, and enabling innovation across industries like healthcare, finance, and entertainment. Without it, modern technology wouldn’t function as seamlessly as it does.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. 1968 NATO Conference**: Coined the term "software engineering," highlighting the need for disciplined development practices.  
2. 1970s Structured Programming**: Introduced modular, organized coding, reducing complexity and improving reliability.  
3. 1990s Agile Movement**: Shifted focus to iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, adapting to changing user needs.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements Gathering: Understand and document what the software needs to do.  
2. Design: Plan the architecture, user interface, and system components.  
3. Implementation (Coding): Write the actual code based on the design.  
4. Testing: Check for bugs and ensure the software works as intended 
5. Deployment: Release the software for users.  
6. Maintenance: Fix issues, update, and improve the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Linear, fixed steps. Good for stable projects (e.g., medical software).
Agile: Iterative, flexible. Best for evolving needs (e.g., apps).

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code, builds features, and fixes bugs. Focuses on creating functional software.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software for bugs, ensures quality, and validates it meets requirements.
Project Manager: Plans, schedules, and oversees the project. Ensures deadlines are met and the team stays on track.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Streamline coding by providing tools like syntax highlighting, debugging, and auto-completion. Example: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS: Track code changes, enable collaboration, and allow reverting to previous versions. Example: Git, GitHub.
Both improve efficiency, reduce errors, and support teamwork in software development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Use Agile methods to adapt quickly.
Bugs & Errors: Implement thorough testing and code reviews.
Time Management: Break tasks into smaller milestones and prioritize.
Team Collaboration: Use tools like Slack, Jira, and regular meetings.
Technical Debt: Refactor code regularly and document thoroughly.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components (e.g., a function). Ensures each part works correctly.
Integration Testing: Checks how components work together. Identifies interface issues.
System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole. Validates overall functionality.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user requirements. Confirms it’s ready for deployment.
Importance: Each type catches issues at different stages, ensuring high-quality, reliable software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering: Designing clear inputs to get accurate AI outputs.

Why It Matters:
Better, relevant responses.
Saves time.
Reduces confusion.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
